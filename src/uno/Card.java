Card is an abstract class that has a color, and an attribut.
an attribut can be either a number (0...9) or a +2, skip,...
Each card also has X and Y coordinates, a width and height, a boolean that indicates if the card is hidden or not,
that will be used to later draw the card on the panel.
Finally, a boolean that indicates if the card can be used or not in the actual situation.
